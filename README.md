## About

A guy that is continously on the grind looking for way to expand my skills while building useful and mostly useless applications. 
I've build custom tooling for myself up to enterprise level applications for FINTECH companies. If my fingers aren't hitting the keyboard to write up code - it's probably writing blogs about my experiences and thoughts about writing code. While I'm not on my computer, I'm spending time chasing my kid around while she's learning about the world around her.
